# Springboard capstone project ideas
## Introduction
My project will be to explore the relationship of Payroll on an MLB team and their success.

## Questions to Answer

1. What is the problem you want to solve?

2. Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?

3. What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?

4. In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).

5. What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.

## Ideas to answer questions

1. I want to see if payroll effect the success of MLB teams

2. My client is MLB owners/GMs and they could decide to spend more money in free angency to improve team if it is determined that an increased payroll does in fact lead to more success.

3. I will be using the data on payroll, winning % and playoff success aquired from Lahman's Baseball database

4. I will look at the correlation of payroll vs winning percentage and payroll vs playoff success. I will calculate how much a team is 
spending in payroll per win and the the percentage of that money compared to total mlb payroll that year.

5. Work in progress...

## Summary
* Key findings of analysis will be here soon
